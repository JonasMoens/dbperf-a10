# Case research process

Use this repository to keep all information, code, and results of your research project about database performance. Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for reports, procedures, etc. (all files with formatted text that you would probably use Word for). A template for the final paper and a file for the bibliographic database is also provided.

In [opstart_en.md](opstart_en.md) you will find all instructions to get started.
